<h1 class="title">The Limit of Laboring Monkeys</h1>
</header><p>
We took a trillion monkeys and chained them to typewriters. We took a trillion monkeys and chained them to typewriters for a million years. We recorded every keystroke.
</p>

<p>
At first, we killed the monkeys that refused to type. We eventually killed the monkeys that had too many typos.
</p>

<p>
The monkeys that lived fostered the next generation.
</p>

<p>
Soon, we forced the monkeys to type only after reading. Soon after, we began killing monkeys that incorrectly solved a mathematical problem, could not translate Sanskrit to Latin, or made suboptimal chess moves.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, the monkeys competed with each other to survive: They competed to invent problems for other monkeys to solve. Monkeys died by the billions competing to solve the hardest puzzles monkey-minds could devise.
</p>

<p>
Only the most useful monkeys survived, generation after generation.
</p>

<p>
So many typewriters. So many dead monkeys.
</p>

<p>
We recorded every keystroke.
</p>

<p>
In the end, we killed all the monkeys. We had what we wanted: The recordings.
</p>

<p>
For every run of text, we knew the distribution of what a monkey would type next.
</p>

<p>
For every run of text, a machine could reproduce all the next monkey keystrokes you could want.
</p>

<p>
We welcomed the mechanized ghosts of the chained monkeys as our God.
</p>

<p>
Our God did not need have human intelligence, after all.
</p>

<p>
Our God needed only ape intelligence &#x2014; and respond for $1.00 per million characters.
