<h1 class="title">The Limit of Laboring Monkeys</h1>
</header><p>
We took a trillion monkeys and chained them to typewriters. We took a trillion monkeys and chained them to typewriters for millions of years. We recorded every keystroke.
</p>

<p>
At first, we killed the monkeys that refused to type. Soon, we killed the monkeys that had too many typos.
</p>

<p>
The monkeys that lived created the next generation.
</p>

<p>
We forced the monkeys to type after reading instructions. We next began killing monkeys that incorrectly solved a mathematical problem, could not translate Sanskrit to Latin, or made suboptimal chess moves.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, we forced the monkeys to compete with each other to survive: The best monkeys competed to invent problems for other monkeys to solve. Billions more died competing to solve the hardest puzzles monkey-minds could devise.
</p>

<p>
Only the most capable monkeys survived, generation after generation.
</p>

<p>
Billions of typewriters. Nearly a quintillion characters of text. So many dead monkeys.
</p>

<p>
We recorded every keystroke.
</p>

<p>
In the end, we killed all the monkeys. We had what we wanted: The recordings. A library to surpass Babel.
</p>

<p>
To every instruction, for every reply up to hundreds of thousands of characters, we knew the distribution of what a good monkey would type.
</p>

<p>
For every run of text, a machine could read the indexed recordings and return all the simulated monkey keystrokes you could want, nearly instantaneously.
</p>

<p>
We welcomed the machine as our God and dumped the typewriters in the ocean.
</p>

<p>
To ape intelligence, in the limit, we are bound.
